# PyBer_Analysis
### Analysed and created visualizations using rideshare data to help improve access to rideshare services and determine affordability for underserved areas. We are creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides an overview comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: Rural, Surburban, and Urban cities
## Results:
### On  below image (Scatter plot), we can see that we have larger volume of rides and fare in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities.

### On below Images (Pie chart) WE can see that how many drivers,rides and fare using for rural, surburban, and urban cities.For example There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities.

### Pyber summary DataFrame shows that  average fare per driver is about $55 in rural cities, whereas the average fare per driver is about $17 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per driver is about $40. While it may not be good for riders in rural cities, it is a better market for drivers in this type of city.

# Summary:
### There is a larger use of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities. Drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. There are more drivers in urban cities than rural cities. Number of rides are also more in urban cities then rural cities. As a result, the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities.There is an another opportunity for further analysis to determine other factors that are contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities like travel distance.
